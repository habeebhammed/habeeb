In traditional sense a library is mainly the collection of documents including both 
print and non-print material which can be housed in a unique fashioned way in a 
separate place. In Modern times, the term libraries refer to any stock which includes 
digital sources, resources and services. The collection includes print, audio and visual 
material in various formats, Video tapes, CDs, DVDs. Cassettes, Video games, e-
maps, microforms, books, audio books and many other electronic resources. 
The libraries can range from public libraries, subscription libraries, and private 
libraries to digital libraries. Therefore a library today is regarded as “a collection of 
useful material for common use.” 
A Public library is generally organized for use and maintained by a public body viz. 
an institution or a private individual. The collection in the public library is intended 
for use by the people who can not afford to purchase expensive and extensive 
collection themselves but need it to gain knowledge related to their area of interest. In 
addition to providing the required material, libraries also provide librarians services 
who are expert in organizing and finding information and at interpreting information.<a href="#top">back to top</a>

access to information in many formats and from many sources. They are extending 
services beyond the physical wall of a building, by providing access by electronic 
means and with the assistance of librarians in navigating and analyzing tremendousamount of information with a variety of digital tools.</p><br>
